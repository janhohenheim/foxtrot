I just reworked this whole thing and didn't get to the readme yet, sorry!

Foxtrot was generated using the [Bevy New 2D](https://github.com/TheBevyFlock/bevy_new_2d) template.
Check out its [documentation](https://github.com/TheBevyFlock/bevy_new_2d/blob/main/README.md) to understand the basis employed in this project.
